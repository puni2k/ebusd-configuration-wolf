Please find here some ebusd configuration files for my Wolf heating system.

Verified:
- CHA 07/10 (Field "CHA Status" is still work in progress, since I have some difficulty with decoding this bitmask in ebusd. Might have to do some post-processing here in Node-RED)
- MM-2 (Most messages have to be requested by polling and have to be chosen according to the configuration of the MM-2)


Note: MM-2 configuration file includes only status fields. Configuration parameters are not included.
